## Challenge Questions

## Easy Level

### 1. FizzBuzz
**Problem:** Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

**Solution:**
```python
def fizzbuzz():
    for i in range(1, 101):
        if i % 15 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)
```

### 2. Palindrome Checker
**Problem:** Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

**Solution:**
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = ''.join(c.lower() for c in s if c.isalnum())
    return s == s[::-1]
```

## Medium Level

### 3. URL Shortener
**Problem:** Design a URL shortening service. Implement a class that can convert a long URL to a short URL and back.

**Solution:**
```python
import hashlib

class URLShortener:
    def __init__(self):
        self.url_map = {}
        self.prefix = "https://short.url/"
    
    def shorten(self, long_url):
        # Create a hash of the URL
        hash_object = hashlib.md5(long_url.encode())
        short_hash = hash_object.hexdigest()[:6]
        short_url = self.prefix + short_hash
        self.url_map[short_url] = long_url
        return short_url
    
    def expand(self, short_url):
        return self.url_map.get(short_url, "URL not found")
```

### 4. Task Scheduler
**Problem:** Given a list of tasks and a cooldown period, find the minimum time required to complete all tasks with the given cooldown between identical tasks.

**Solution:**
```python
def least_interval(tasks, cooldown):
    from collections import Counter
    
    task_counts = Counter(tasks).values()
    max_count = max(task_counts)
    max_tasks = sum(1 for count in task_counts if count == max_count)
    
    return max(len(tasks), (max_count - 1) * (cooldown + 1) + max_tasks)
```

## Hard Level

### 5. Distributed Key-Value Store
**Problem:** Design a simple distributed key-value store that can handle multiple read/write operations with consistency guarantees.

**Solution Architecture:**
```python
class DistributedKVStore:
    def __init__(self, nodes):
        self.nodes = nodes  # List of node addresses
        self.data = {node: {} for node in nodes}
        self.version = 0
    
    def put(self, key, value):
        self.version += 1
        # Write to all nodes (synchronous for strong consistency)
        for node in self.nodes:
            if key not in self.data[node]:
                self.data[node][key] = {}
            self.data[node][key]['value'] = value
            self.data[node][key]['version'] = self.version
        return self.version
    
    def get(self, key):
        # Read from all nodes and return the latest version
        latest = None
        for node in self.nodes:
            if key in self.data[node]:
                if latest is None or self.data[node][key]['version'] > latest['version']:
                    latest = self.data[node][key]
        return latest['value'] if latest else None
```

### 6. Real-time Analytics Dashboard
**Problem:** Design a system that processes a stream of user events and displays real-time analytics on a dashboard.

**Solution Components:**
1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Kafka/PubSub for event streaming
2. **Stream Processing**: Apache Flink/Spark Streaming
3. **Storage**: Time-series database (InfluxDB/TimescaleDB)
4. **API Layer**: FastAPI/Node.js for serving analytics
5. **Frontend**: React/Vue.js with WebSockets for real-time updates

**Example Implementation (Simplified):**
```python
# API Endpoint for analytics
@app.get("/api/analytics")
async def get_analytics(time_window: str = "1h"):
    # Query time-series database for metrics
    # Return aggregated data for the dashboard
    return {
        "active_users": get_active_users(time_window),
        "popular_events": get_popular_events(time_window),
        "conversion_rate": get_conversion_rate(time_window)
    }
```

## Bonus: System Design

### 7. Design Twitter
**Key Components:**
1. **Tweets Service**: Handle tweet creation, reading, and deletion
2. **User Service**: User profiles and authentication
3. **Social Graph**: Followers/following relationships
4. **News Feed**: Generate and serve timeline
5. **Media Service**: Handle image/video uploads
6. **Search**: Enable searching tweets and users

**Scaling Considerations:**
- Sharding databases by user_id
- Caching with Redis/Memcached
- CDN for static content
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical tasks

### 8. Rate Limiter
**Problem:** Implement a rate limiter that allows 100 requests per minute per user.

**Solution (Token Bucket Algorithm):**
```python
import time
from collections import defaultdict

class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, capacity, refill_rate):
        self.capacity = capacity  # Max tokens
        self.refill_rate = refill_rate  # tokens per second
        self.tokens = defaultdict(lambda: capacity)
        self.last_refill = defaultdict(time.time)
    
    def is_allowed(self, user_id):
        current_time = time.time()
        time_passed = current_time - self.last_refill[user_id]
        self.tokens[user_id] = min(
            self.capacity,
            self.tokens[user_id] + time_passed * self.refill_rate
        )
        self.last_refill[user_id] = current_time
        
        if self.tokens[user_id] >= 1:
            self.tokens[user_id] -= 1
            return True
        return False
```
